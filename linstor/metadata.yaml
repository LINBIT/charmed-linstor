  LINSTOR developed by LINBIT®, is a software that manages replicated volumes across a group of machines

  LINSTOR system consists of multiple server and client components. A LINSTOR controller manages the configuration of the
  LINSTOR cluster and all of its managed storage resources. The LINSTOR satellite component manages creation, modification
  and deletion of storage resources on each node that provides or uses storage resources managed by LINSTOR.
